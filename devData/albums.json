They also posted on their website and Facebook page that this would be the title for their upcoming fifth official studio album. Later, on December 16, the group posted a tweet containing the phrase 'it won't lit', eventually revealed to be a lyric from the Bottomless Pit track 'BB Poison'. On February 6, 2016, Death Grips released the song 'Hot Head' from their upcoming album onto their SoundCloud and YouTube accounts.
