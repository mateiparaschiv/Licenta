They also posted on their website and Facebook page that this would be the title for their upcoming fifth official studio album. Later, on December 16, the group posted a tweet containing the phrase 'it won't lit', eventually revealed to be a lyric from the Bottomless Pit track 'BB Poison'. On February 6, 2016, Death Grips released the song 'Hot Head' from their upcoming album onto their SoundCloud and YouTube accounts. The cover art and tracklisting were then revealed on March 18, followed on April 19 by the announcement of a May 6 release date and a download link for a document containing lyrics for each track on the album.
